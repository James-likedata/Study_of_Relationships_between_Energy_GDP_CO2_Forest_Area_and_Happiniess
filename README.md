# Study_of_Relationships_between_Energy_GDP_CO2_Forest_Area_and_Happiniess

As we all know energy is very important for economic development of every country. It is the basis for GDP, but meanwhile energy consumption may cause CO2 emission, especially by coal and oil.We also would like to study the Forest Area per capita, because trees are the main way to capture CO2 emission and transform it into oxygen. Last but not least, we will study relationship between GDP and happiness indicator. Based on the data collection, we will study from 2010 to 2020 and focus on 10 representative countries.
